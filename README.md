# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of wine quality using machine learning algorithms. We used two datasets — red and white wine data — to explore features affecting wine quality and applied various algorithms to predict and evaluate performance.

## 📂 Datasets

- `winequality-red.csv`
- `winequality-white.csv`

## 📊 Objective

- Analyze features influencing wine quality.
- Predict wine quality using classification and regression models.
- Compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Mean Squared Error (for regression)
- R² Score

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## 📌 Key Findings

- Certain features like alcohol content and volatile acidity have a strong influence on wine quality.
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed best in classification.
- Regression models gave decent predictions but classification yielded better interpretability.
